# Inverse Graph Partitioning
Inverse graph partitioning (IGP) dedicates to maximize the number of edges between these subgraphs and minimize connections inside subgraphs. The IGP problem arises in several practical situations. One important example is detention room assignment (DRA). In a detention center, detainees with social relationships should be assigned to different rooms whenever possible to reduce their contact with each other; otherwise they may collaborate against the management of the officers, bully others or cooperate in concealing crimes. Another practical example of IGP comes from the field of vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications. Vehicles sharing the same spectrum or frequency point should preferably be assigned to different communication clusters to alleviate their mutual interference under high vehicle density. In addition, some recent studies from social network analysis have focused on anti-community detection whose purpose is to reveal the anti-community structure (i.e., disassortative structure) of a network. Anti-community structure refers to that nodes have no or few connections inside communities, but share most of their connections between different communities.


"Relationship Networks for Inverse Graph Partitioning" is a dataset for IGP.
